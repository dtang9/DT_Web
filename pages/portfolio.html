                <p>In Fall 2018, I helped work on the ACM Social Media Software project. There were
                    30 students who worked on it. The project allows users to create accounts and
                    share updates with each other. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I helped create
                    the sign up page. I made sure that all user sign up information, such as phone
                    number and password, were in the correct format and length.

                <p>In August 2018, I started on my first personal project. Using JavaFX, which I recently
                    learned from one of my programming classes, I created an application that allows users to
                    fill in their contact information. Then they can customize their pizza order with toppings,
                    the number of pizzas to order, and display the cost.

# DT_Web
This project was for the ACM Spring 2019, Web Development Workshop.  
I expanded my knowledge about beginner HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some Bootstrap in the workshops. 
I applied these skills when I created a personal website. The website contains the following pages: About me, Resume, and Portfolio.
The website is incomplete and is still in progress.

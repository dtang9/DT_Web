# DT_Web
This project is for ACM Spring 2019, Web Development Workshop.  
I am continuing to learn more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some Bootstrap in the workshops. 
I am applying these skills by creating a personal website. The website will contain the following pages: About me, Resume, Portfolio, and Contact.
The website is incomplete and is still in progress.
